<!-- once we install the git in our local , when ever we right click we can able to see git bash here, and git gui here  -->

<!-- git is runnning in our local  and we need to send our code to git hub -->

<!-- if we want to initialize git in our project

          by using ==> git clone " repo url"

-->

<!-- what atre the phases to send data to git hub? those are as follows  

                  ==> 1.working directory 
                  ==> 2. staging/index   
                  ==> 3. local repository  -->

<!-- if you want to check the status of the changed files we are using this command ==> git status -->

<!--  how you identify your changed files are availble in which pahse ?
    if you run git status command ==> 
    if the file shows red color it is in working directory,
    if the file is showing greeen color it's in staging/index, 
    if it's showing nothing to commit and working tree clean it's in local repository -->

    <!-- if you want to create a branch 
    
    we're using  ==> git branch branchNmae

    if you want to checkout to that branch 

    we're using ==> git checkout branchName

    if you want to create andf checkout at the same time 

    we're using  ==> git checkout -b branchName

    if you want to check the branch list

    we're using ==> git branch
     
    note : always create a branch from base branch , don't create new branch from another new branch and ,maintain proper naming convesion for branch name [like ticket id and description]
    -->

<!-- if you want to tranfer data from working directory to staging/index

 we're using 
==> git add fileName  ==> it will transfer onely the mentioned file into staging/index

==> git add .  ==> it will transfer all modified files to staging/index -->

<!-- if you want to hide the content after tranfer data from local repository to staging/index

we're using ==> git stash [it will hide the data]

if you want to retrive the data which you are hidden 

if you want to check the hidden list

we're using ==> git stash --list

we're using ==> git statsh apply (or) ==> git stash pop


-->

<!-- if you want to tranfer data from  staging/index to local repository

        we're using 
                  ==> git commit -m " commit message it's optional and understandable for every one"
                  
-->


<!--  if you want to transfer our local repository data to git hub repo 

we're using

   ==> git push command  , in fisrt push it's looking for origin branch at that time we can use git push --set-upstream origin/brach'
   
   ==> if you want to take the latest code from repo 
    
   ==> we're using ==> git pull 

   ==> recommended:  always take the latest pull before pushing your changes
-->

<!-- to fetch the info ==> git fetch --all -->
 
<!-- if you want to combine one branch in another branch 
 
we're using ==> git merge (or)  ==> git rebase
-->

<!-- if you want to combine multiple commits in single commits

 we are using 

 ===> git rebase -i head~no of commits we need to sqaush  [after running this command it will open vi editor]

  ==> if incase you are not selected proper commits count then you need to run git rebase --abort command [it will stop the rebase]


 ===> if you want to edit text in vi editor we are using [shift + i (or) i  ==> these are for insert the data or text]

 ===> we need to check the commits which commits need to sqaush change the text pick to squash or s 


 ===> after inseting the content and if you want to save the inserting content and quit the vi editor we're using [:wq!]

 ===> after that again it will open vi editor and we need to change the commit message , for inserting we are using [shift + i (or) i ]

 ==> after inserting the commit message we need to save and quit the vi editor  ==> [:wq!]

 ==> the we need to run ==> git push -f to push your commits to repository [this is not recommended]
